# Moderation

## What does it do?
The moderation plugin contains all of the moderation commands in the bot.

### What are strikes?
Every moderation action you perform on a user will give them a preset number of strikes (configurable). The number of strikes represents the severity of the punishment. You can setup [automod](/) to automatically give users a certain number of strikes based when it is triggered. When a user reaches a preset number of strikes, they will automatically be punished.
